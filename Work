Performing Data Cleaning and Analysis

1. Understanding meaning of each column:
Data Dictionary: 
Variable Description

Survived - Survived (1) or died (0)
Pclass - Passenger’s class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
Name - Passenger’s name
Sex - Passenger’s sex
Age - Passenger’s age
SibSp - Number of siblings/spouses aboard
Parch - Number of parents/children aboard (Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.)
Ticket - Ticket number
Fare - Fare
Cabin - Cabin
Embarked - Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

2. Analysing which columns are completely useless in predicting the survival and deleting them
Note - Don't just delete the columns because you are not finding it useful. Or focus is not on deleting the columns. Our focus is on analysing how each column is affecting the result or the prediction and in accordance with that deciding whether to keep the column or to delete the column or fill the null values of the column by some values and if yes, then what values.
